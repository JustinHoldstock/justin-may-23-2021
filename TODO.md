Notes:
- Tests
- responsive
- Questions.MD for technical Qs
- pause stream on tab navigation
- only update total if previous has changed, better aggregate calculation 
- I really want to add Jest to this project, but had to opt for built in Jasmine due to time

Stretch goals
- total bar underneath each row
- row highlight
